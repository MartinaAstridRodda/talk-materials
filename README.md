# talk-materials
A somewhat unorthodox repo for supplementary materials for talks.

I need a place to host my supplementary materials, such as bibliographies, when I give a presentation in a format that doesn't support it (bibliographies on slides...).
In the future, this space may end up hosting more GitHub-appropriate materials, such as any code I write for talk-sized experiments.
